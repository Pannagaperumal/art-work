The purpose of this document is to offer insights into the improvements made and their impact on the project's functionality and performance.

## Commit 1: Added Test for Product Listing and Login

### Optimized Code with Explanations
- **Tests Added**: New test cases were added for the `Login` and `ProductListingSection` components.
- **Login Component Tests**: Ensures the component renders correctly, includes a login button, and handles user input.
- **Product Listing Tests**: Verifies that the `ProductListingSection` component renders without crashing and displays a message when no products match.

### Test Cases and Results
- **Login Component**:
  - Renders without crashing.
  - Contains a login button.
  - Handles user input correctly.
- **Product Listing Component**:
  - Renders without crashing.
  - Displays a message when no products match.

## Commit 2 :Added Lazy Loading, Pagination, and Refactoring

### Optimized Code with Explanations
- **Lazy Loading**: Implemented lazy loading for images using the `loading="lazy"` attribute, improving initial page load time.
- **Pagination**: Added infinite scrolling to load more products as the user scrolls, reducing initial data load and enhancing user experience.
- **Refactoring**: Code was refactored for better readability and maintainability.

### Before/After Performance Comparison
- **Before**: All products and images were loaded at once, leading to longer initial load times.
- **After**: Lazy loading and pagination reduce initial load time and improve responsiveness, especially on slower connections.

### Test Cases and Results
- **Product Listing Section**:
  - Successfully loads additional products on scroll.
  - Images load only when in the viewport, reducing unnecessary data usage.
